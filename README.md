# 🛳 Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 🎯 Internship Task 5 – Data Analyst Role

This project explores the Titanic dataset using Python libraries such as Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib. The goal is to analyze survival trends based on passenger features and develop insights through visualizations.

## 📂 Repository Structure


---

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib

---

## 📊 Key Explorations
- Distribution of Age and Fare
- Survival rate by Gender, Passenger Class, and Embarked Port
- Correlation heatmaps and pairplots
- Outlier detection via boxplots
- Grouped bar plots and survival comparisons

---

## 🔍 Key Findings
- 3rd class passengers were the most, likely due to low average fare (~₹13)
- 1st class passengers had the highest fare (~₹84) and higher survival rate
- Female passengers had significantly higher survival rates than males
- Age group 20–40 had the highest number of passengers
- Most passengers embarked from Port 'S' (Southampton)
- Clear outliers observed in Fare and Age distributions

---

## 📄 Final Insights
The analysis highlights how class, fare, age, and gender impacted survival. Data visualizations reveal hidden patterns that would not be obvious from raw data alone.

---

## 📌 Submission Ready
This repository contains all the files required for submission including:
- A clean, well-documented notebook
- Final PDF report
- README summary
- Original dataset file
